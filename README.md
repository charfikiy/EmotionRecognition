In this project we have developed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model for Facial Expression Recognition. Every facial expression is classified into one of the six expressions considered for this project. We implemented convolution-reLU-fully connected layers followed by softmax. To reduce the overfitting of models, we used dropout and local response normalization. To recognize emotions at real time we capture live images from video frames and this image is sent to the model for prediction, then the model outputs the emotion. The test accuracy obtained is 60.1%.<br />

DataSets: FERC-2013(Facial Expression Recognition Challenge) and RaFD(Radboud Faces Database) <br />
FERC contains <br />
i)   28,709 Training images <br />
ii)  3589 Private Test images <br />
iii) 3589 Public Test images <br />

Installation Dependencies: <br />

1) Python 3.5
2) Tensorflow 1.0
3) TFLearn
4) OpenCV 2.0

Tensorflow can either be GPU or CPU version. The model runs faster on a GPU. GPU version of Tensorflow requires additional installations such as CUDAÂ® Toolkit 8.0, NVIDIA drivers associated with CUDA Toolkit 8.0, CuDNN v5.1

It is preferable to install Python through Anaconda as you get all the dependencies installed such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and other libraries.

Python IDE's : Pycharm or IPython notebook or any other preferred.
